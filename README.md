mjosborne1 is an experienced Laboratory/Pathology IT person with 10+ years of multi-disclipline experience as a scientist in a large private Pathology business, and more than 15 years as a laboratory information systems and integration specialist. I like to dabble in web technologies, especially Visual Studio .Net, javascript frameworks, nodejs robotics and python for bioinformatics. What I find when learning by my self at home is that I often can only get so deep into a project then I get bogged down and restart in another technology. I would like to get better at finishing projects.
